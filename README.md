## On-chain DAO: 

Proposals can be voted on via the website. Only on-chain votes of DAOs that the user has a membership
token of in their wallet will, be shown. 

Each proposal goes through the following stages: 

 0 Pending \
 __________\
 1 Active\
 __________\
 2 Canceled\
 3 Defeated\
 4 Succeeded\
 __________\
 5 Queued \
 6 Expired \
 7 Executed

When the proposal is active, users can vote on it. All votes are shown via
Vote.js page

## Deployment: 

However, Rinkeby Testnet was taken down, which is why it no longer works.
Website was live and deployed to AWS amplify (https://master.djf2f3efc4uda.amplifyapp.com/) before.
